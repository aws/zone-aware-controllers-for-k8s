                  A pod will be in this map from the time when the API server processed
                  the eviction request to the time when the pod is seen by ZDB controller
                  as having been marked for deletion (or after a timeout). The key
                  in the map is the name of the pod and the value is the time when
                  the API server processed the eviction request. If the deletion didn't
                  occur and a pod is still there it will be removed from the list
                  automatically by ZoneDisruptionBudget controller after some time.
